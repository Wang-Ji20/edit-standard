persistent editorial history

code convention:

- test driven development

- use struct for data structures, use class for objects. they are different.

- short function, less params, do NOT use out params.

- small classes

- only inherit interfaces, program to interfaces

- use exceptions, static, constexpr, const, assert liberally

- .cc for c++ source, .hh for c++ header, .h for C & C++ compatible header, .c for c source

- others are enforced by .clangd & .editorconfig
